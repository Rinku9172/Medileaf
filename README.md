##  Problem Statement Introduction
 Due to the rich floral diversity in India and high demand for medicinal plants, The proposal of using software capable of identifying these plants through image processing and machine learning algorithms can offer various benefits.
Machine learning algorithms can be trained on vast datasets of plant images, allowing them to recognize different types of medicinal plants and can significantly enhance the accuracy of plant identification.
Solution: To create a Cross-Platform Mobile application and website in which  user can scan or upload image of the plant and he/she will get the output such as name of the plant, medicinal properties, details of the disease and other details. 
 We will use ML model for image processing and to get the details of the plant. We will use Figma for designing and Flutter framework for development.
In our mobile application, user can also scan at botanical gardens to get all details of the plants with their medicinal properties.
User can also save the plants they wish to view later,  also user can search using the system’s search bar or by using voice recognition.

## Abstract

India, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and similar characteristics. Moreover, the extensive consumption to meet demand-supply ratio exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. It further leads to the practice of adulteration, substitution, and disbelief in the curative capability of the system eventually. Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms will be of immense use. It will be helpful at every level viz. wholesaler, distributor, etc. of the supply chain of raw material being utilized in the system.
